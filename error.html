        <h1>Moby Dick宇都宮アパートメント｜ブリランテ</h1>
        <h2>CHAPTER 1. Loomings.</h2>
        <p>
          Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely–having
          little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me
          on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery
          part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and
          regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about
          the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul;
          whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses,
          and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially
          whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a
          strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into
          the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off then, I
          account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my
          substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato
          throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is
          nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in
          their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same
          feelings towards the ocean with me.
